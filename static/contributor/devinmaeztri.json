  "your_contribution": "I subscribed to WordPress.com once back in 2014, but never got really into the WordPress world until I was tricked by the biggest WordPress enthusiast who stole my heart. He created an online CV for me to help me look for a job as a Christmas gift. He dragged me to volunteer at WordCamp Denpasar in 2016. Then, I got to learn about the different ways people use WordPress at a WordPress Meet-up in Jakarta and Ubud and then I became an organiser for WorCamp Ubud. It seems that it never ends as I signed up as WordCamp Jakarta organizer and now I have three sites on WordPress.com.",
